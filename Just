A In twilight's gentle, dusky hue, The stars emerge, a sparkling crew. Whispers of the evening breeze, Dance among the swaying trees. Moonlight casts its silver glow, On rivers' calm and steady flow. Night's embrace, a velvet shroud, Wrapping earth in mystic cloud. Dreams awaken, taking flight, Beneath the canopy of night.
